# appjs

Helper scripts for https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-multi-device-reveng/blob/main/inspect-app.md

`extract.sh` extracts all web app JS
`beautify.sh`  beautifies its contents so it's easier to mess with it
`pack.sh` puts them all back in and prints a hash

macOS only so far, feel free to PR for more platforms.
